ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m <b>Mattia</b>.
- I work as <a href="https://www.cmcc.it/it/people/scalas-mattia">Urban climate data analyst at the CMCC Foundation</a>, dealing with GIS, data viz, microclimate simulations and other very interesting stuff.
- I hold a PhD in <i>Urban and Regional Development</i> at <a href="https://www.polito.it/didattica/dottorato-di-ricerca-e-scuola-di-specializzazione/alumni?p=058463">Politecnico di Torino</a>.
- In addition to theoretical research in the field of territorial vulnerability assessment, I am interested in everything related to Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
- I have been working for years with data analysis through Python and Desktop GIS (both QGIS and ESRI products) and Iâ€™m always learning about Geo-data, analysis, maps and development skills.
- I mainly use Python for analysis, and Javascript and Node.js to develop.
- I do not use often my personal GitHub profile, but I will slowly release some geo-spatial related projects hoping to network and between GIS and spatial-data people.
